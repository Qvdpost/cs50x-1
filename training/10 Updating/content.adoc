= Training: updating the IDE

== Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and execute

[source]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. If you somehow closed your terminal window (and can't find it!), make sure that *Console* is checked under the *View* menu, then click the green, circled plus (+) in CS50 IDE's bottom half, then select *New Terminal*.

Next, execute

[source]
----
mkdir ~/workspace/pset2/
----

at your prompt in order to make a directory called `pset2` in your `workspace` directory. Take care not to overlook the space between `mkdir` and `~/workspace/pset2/` or any other character for that matter!  Keep in mind that `~` denotes your home directory, `~/workspace/` denotes a directory called `workspace` therein, and `~/workspace/pset2/` denotes a directory called `pset2` within `~/workspace/`.

Now execute

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/
----

to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

[source]
----
~/workspace/pset2/ $
----

If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong. You can actually execute

[source,bash]
----
history
----

at the prompt to see your last several commands in chronological order if you'd like to do some sleuthing. You can also scroll through the same one line at a time by hitting your keyboard's up and down arrows; hit Enter to re-execute any command that you'd like.
