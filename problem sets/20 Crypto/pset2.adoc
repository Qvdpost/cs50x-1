= Problem Set 2: Crypto

== tl;dr

[start=0]
. Watch link:/lectures/lecture-2[Lecture 2].
. Choose two out of three adventures:
+
--
* Implement Caesar's cipher.
* Implement Vigenère's cipher.
* Crack passwords.
--
+
. Submit your code.

== Help

For information on (or help with) this Problem Set:

[start=0]
. Watch the walkthroughs herein.
. Attend your tutor's *section*.
* Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).
. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.
. Visit (or email) the course's heads.

== Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on link:/#academic_honesty[academic honesty], particularly its link:/#regret["regret clause"].

== Reminders

Per link:/lectures/week-2[Lecture 2]:

* Use `help50` as needed.
* Use `eprintf` as needed.
* Use `debug50` as needed.

== Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and execute

[source]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. If you somehow closed your terminal window (and can't find it!), make sure that *Console* is checked under the *View* menu, then click the green, circled plus (+) in CS50 IDE's bottom half, then select *New Terminal*.

Next, execute

[source]
----
mkdir ~/workspace/pset2/
----

at your prompt in order to make a directory called `pset2` in your `workspace` directory. Take care not to overlook the space between `mkdir` and `~/workspace/pset2/` or any other character for that matter!  Keep in mind that `~` denotes your home directory, `~/workspace/` denotes a directory called `workspace` therein, and `~/workspace/pset2/` denotes a directory called `pset2` within `~/workspace/`.

Now execute

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/
----

to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

[source]
----
~/workspace/pset2/ $
----

If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong. You can actually execute

[source,bash]
----
history
----

at the prompt to see your last several commands in chronological order if you'd like to do some sleuthing. You can also scroll through the same one line at a time by hitting your keyboard's up and down arrows; hit Enter to re-execute any command that you'd like.

== What to Do

Implement any two (2) of:

* link:/problems/caesar/[Caesar], less comfortable
* link:/problems/vigenere/[Vigenère], less comfortable
* link:/problems/crack/[Crack], more comfortable

You're welcome but not expected to implement all three; if you submit all three, we'll grade your two best.

== How to Submit

. Make sure you are signed in to this website!
. In the form below, add the files that you downloaded.
. Press "Submit for grading". Presto!

This was Problem Set 2.
