== Help

* Watch Zamyla's walkthroughs herein.
* Watch Week 1's course-wide section video, linked at https://cs50.harvard.edu/weeks[].
* Post questions and search answers in https://discourse.cs50.net/[CS50 Discourse]. When you register, make sure your username is the same as your GitHub username! Email heads@cs50.harvard.edu if you don't see any topics after logging in (and thus might not yet have access). If you haven't turned in the Problem Set 0 form yet, we don't know your GitHub username, and thus you won't have access.
* Attend https://cs50.harvard.edu/hours[office hours] beginning Thu 2/1.
